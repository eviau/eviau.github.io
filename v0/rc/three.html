<h2 id="my-last-three-weeks-at-rc">3 - My last three weeks at RC</h2>

<p><em>Dec 18th, 2020</em></p>

<p>The tenth week of my time at RC was spent taking care of personal matters. Not much was done that week besides postponing everything.</p>

<p>The eleventh week was slow - and not so steady. The end of the year is coming, the days are getting shorter in this part of the world, and energy levels are low. I decided to take up running again, and to work on an arts project of mine for the rest of the batch. I got stuck in the <a href="https://eviau.github.io/ecrits/os_programming.html">OS programming tutorial</a> I wanted to finish - this might bring the project to a natural end for me, for now. I had interesting discussions during a non-tech talk on art about finance, finance as a medium artworks I know of.</p>

<p>The last week - of which today is the last day - was spent working on a chatbot for an arts project that is not yet ready to go live. When it does, I will post about it on my <a href="https://www.github.com/eviau">Github profile</a>, and later on on my <a href="https://eviau.github.io">personal website</a>.</p>

<p>Today is the last day of my batch. I learned lots of various things at various levels of abstraction about computers, programming and computer science in general. I met interesting, kind people with a diverse range of skills and work/life experiences. I was able to spend time learning about what I felt was the most important for me, for now - hopefully becoming better at programming in the process!</p>

<p>Although this year was not an easy year, being at Virtual RC made my days better.</p>

<p>Thanks everyone - and see you soon :)</p>
