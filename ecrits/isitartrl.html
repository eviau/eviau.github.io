<h2 id="is-it-art-a-reinforcement-learning-algorithm">Is It Art ? A reinforcement learning algorithm</h2>

<p>v0 : I adapted OpenAI gym reinforcement learning framework into an algorithm that tries to learn what the user considers to be art, for a 100x100 pixels image.</p>

<p>v1 : I updated the algorithm by adding a proper agent and making it self-contained! plus a GUI!</p>

<p><em>What is art?</em> is a question that humanity have been pondering for quite a time now… :)</p>

<p>With the advent of computing and so-called artificial intelligence algorithms, the question of human creativity and how it is defined has been taking more and more place in the discussion.</p>

<p>My question is: is there an algorithm that can learn what one’s would define as art, without ever having seen such art ?</p>
