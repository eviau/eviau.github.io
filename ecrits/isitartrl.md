# Is It Art ? A reinforcement learning algorithm

v0 : I adapted OpenAI gym reinforcement learning framework into an algorithm that tries to learn what the user considers to be art, for a 100x100 pixels image.

v1 : I updated the algorithm by adding a proper agent and making it self-contained! plus a GUI!

*What is art?* is a question that humanity have been pondering for quite a time now... :)

With the advent of computing and so-called artificial intelligence algorithms, the question of human creativity and how it is defined has been taking more and more place in the discussion.

My question is: is there an algorithm that can learn what one's would define as art, without ever having seen such art ?
