<h2 id="csv2html---with-python">csv2html - with Python</h2>
<p>If you have a list of Things that you are maintaining and using as a single source of information for various documents, why not put the list into a csv and then use Python to generate the document?</p>
<p>Here is how to do this for a tiny <code>index.html</code> kind of webpage.</p>
<h3 id="create-and-maintain-the-.csv-file">Create and maintain the .csv file</h3>
<p>This is probably the hardest part.</p>
<ul>
<li>Create a <code>.csv</code> file with the relevant column headers.</li>
</ul>
<p>For a blog, this might be <code>date</code>, <code>author</code>, <code>title</code>, and <code>abstract</code>.</p>
<ul>
<li>Add the information to the <code>.csv</code> file.</li>
</ul>
<p>One blog post by row, fill the columns with the information about the blog posts that you have.</p>
<ul>
<li>Maintain the .csv file</li>
</ul>
<p>Everytime a new blog post appear, add it to the .csv file.</p>
<h3 id="write-a-tiny-python-script-to-generate-html-from-the-.csv">Write a tiny Python script to generate HTML from the .csv</h3>
<p>Here is an <a href="https://github.com/eviau/eviau.github.io/blob/main/generate/extenso.py">example I use to generate the extenso.html page</a>. Yes, it is hard-coded. Yes, I might change it. Yes, it works.</p>
<p>The idea is to… :</p>
<ul>
<li>Import the .csv into a dataframe (using pandas), or read it line by line.</li>
</ul>
<p>I found it easier to build with pandas because I already know how it works, feel welcome to adjust to your needs and current level of skill.</p>
<ul>
<li>Decide on how you want to format the file</li>
</ul>
<p>Maybe you need every <code>date</code> to be in bold, maybe you want the <code>title</code> to be a <code>&lt;h2&gt;</code> heading…</p>
<ul>
<li>Write a script that logs to the terminal every tag you need, with all the information.</li>
</ul>
<p>E.g. for our <code>.csv</code> file that generates an <code>index.html</code>, I could have:</p>
<pre><code># first, let&#39;s go row by row and output one row
for row in dataframe.iterrows():
    
    # we start a paragraph
    print(&quot;&lt;p&gt;&quot;)
    # we print the blog post with the following formatting
    # &lt;DATE&gt; : &lt;TITLE&gt;, by &lt;AUTHOR&gt;. &lt;ABSTRACT&gt;
    print(dataframe[&#39;date&#39;] + &quot;:&quot; + &quot;dataframe[&#39;title&#39;] + &#39;, by &#39; + dataframe[&#39;author&#39;] + &#39;.&#39; + dataframe[&#39;abstract&#39;])
    # we could add a link with the following:
    print(&#39;&lt;a href=&quot;&#39; + dataframe[&#39;url&#39;] + &#39;&quot;&gt;&#39; + dataframe[&#39;title&#39;] + &#39;&lt;/a&gt;&#39;)
    # we close the paragraph
    print(&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&quot;) </code></pre>
<p>We could concatenate all the arguments of the <code>print</code>s into one <code>print</code> to avoid skipping line - or we could look at the Python docs to do it properly.</p>
<p>But remember - we are duct-taping a website tooling suite here, no need to go into all the details!</p>
<ul>
<li>Copy-paste the HTML log from the terminal to the <code>index.html</code> template you <a href="./duct-tape-blogging.html">created earlier on</a></li>
</ul>
<p>That’s it. We are done!</p>
<h3 id="potential-lists-to-consider-for-this-approach">Potential lists to consider for this approach</h3>
<p>I’ve used similar scripts combined with a .csv file to make TeX and HTML documents of…</p>
<ul>
<li>blog posts</li>
<li>arts projects</li>
<li>jobs</li>
<li>education</li>
</ul>
<p>Or, generally speaking, just anything that could be on a CV ?</p>
<h3 id="but-why">But why ??</h3>
<p>Learning how things are made is a great way to improve your skills.</p>
<p>Knowing when to reduce the scope is a nice way to learn more things.</p>
<p>The problem I am trying to solve with these idea is the fact that if you are blogging infrequently, or for any website really, using a framework might be more work on your part than just having a bunch of <code>.md</code> files that you move onto <code>.html</code> with a script.</p>
<p>Would I put this in production for a Major Website? No. Do I have a Major Website? Also no.</p>
<p>Feel welcome to adapt the <code>extenso.py</code> script to your needs, and have fun focusing on the writing part, not the tooling.</p>
