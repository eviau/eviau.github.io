<p>In this second of four blog posts on how I am spending my time at the Recuse Center (RC for short), I will cover my next three weeks and do some planning.</p>
<p>Last time we chatted, I was pondering what I would be working on at RC. I was trying to decide if I would focus on esolangs, on historical fundamentals in computer science, or on a small, minimalistic text editor that I am coding, based on the kilo tutorial by snaptoken. I was also interested in doing lots of pair programming!</p>
<h2 id="how-things-went">How things went</h2>
<h3 id="esolang">Esolang</h3>
<p>My <a href="https://github.com/eviau/fleuve">fleuve</a> design for an esolang was featured in the Joy of Computing RC blog!! Did not work on it as much as expected though - I plan on spending a good week on this, and then will probably have to shelve it for some time, to focus on job search activities.</p>
<h3 id="historical-fundamentals-in-cs">Historical Fundamentals in CS</h3>
<p>The reading is going well, the discussion group is always insightful - I am glad I decided to focus on this, my understanding of fundamentals in CS has greatly increased.</p>
<h3 id="apeiron-the-text-editor">Apeiron, the text editor</h3>
<p>I have finished the parts of the tutorial that were relevant to my project! I did my coding in Python instead of C, which was a great way to do some actual coding and not just copy-paste lines from the tutorial. I presented three 5-min talks at RC based on things I learned while doing this project: the history of control characters; the difference between raw and canonical modes; how displaying information on the screen works at a low-level. Recently, I have started implementing classes in the code to make it easy to update the code with new features. The main feature I want to do is the ability to switch between three different display modes: one that is a text editor, the second that is a list of files in the current directory, and the last one, the focus mode, where only the task at hand is displayed. The project is evolving from being a text editor to being an agenda/todo app - stay tuned! <a href="https://github.com/eviau/apeiron">link to the GitHub repo</a></p>
<h3 id="pair-programming">Pair programming</h3>
<p>I was curious about pair programming, having done no such thing since my graduate school years. It went super well, and it is definitely a great way to learn and to improve. Thanks to everyone for pairing with me :)</p>
<h3 id="os-programming">OS programming</h3>
<p>As I was getting curious about how often the screen is refreshed as we are using the computer, I was sent down a rabbit hole of GPU and OS information on this topic - which soon prompted me to consider <a href="https://eviau.github.io/ecrits/os_programming.html">writing my own, small, tiny, OS</a>. Having found a <a href="https://www.cl.cam.ac.uk/projects/raspberrypi/tutorials/os/">good tutorial</a> on writing basic OS features for the raspberry pi, I started coding along. I am currently at the stage where the code is making sense to me, although not quite there yet when it comes to writing in assembly. Having had the success of apeiron is helping me build the confidence that I can figure things out and that everything will wrap together at some point!</p>
<h3 id="arts-project">Arts project</h3>
<p>And last but not least, I had the time to not do an arts project for the non-happening <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20200624170038/https://biennale.no/">biennale.no</a> !</p>
<h3 id="varia-and-non-tech-things">Varia and non-tech things</h3>
<p>I did a presentation on things I learned about programming by baking macarons! Got a chance to talk about my <a href="https://eviau.github.io/ecrits/complexitejeu.html">systemizing game design using NP-hard problems</a> approach to game development! Watched a great variety of technical talks! Worked on redesigning my website and learned lots about web accessibility! Built a csv-&gt;HTML pipeline, based on the csv-&gt;pdf pipeline I have for my CV! Worked on getting a betting understanding of various programming paradigms through pairing on small problems!</p>
<h2 id="the-next-three-weeks">The next three weeks</h2>
<p>I think I am going to give myself a few days to decide on what to focus for the next half of the batch. I want to finish the OS programming tutorial, and start working on <a href="http://bibliotheques-mtl.herokuapp.com/">data development</a> projects. I would like to write 2-3 blog posts about how to go <a href="https://github.com/eviau/excel2python">from Excel to Python</a> as a data analyst. I should take some more time to properly document my work - writing README on my GitHub repos, e.g. - and I will soon be looking for a full time job.</p>
