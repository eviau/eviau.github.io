<p>Last May, I decided to do some self-structured work on my arts projects in the shape of a <a href="https://eviau.github.io/residencesolo/">self-residence, at home</a>. I wanted to see how well I could/would adjust to self-directed learning, in a slightly more structured way than what I was used to.</p>
<p>Having enjoyed the experience, I was soon applying (again) to the <a href="https://www.recurse.com">Recurse Center</a>, a self-directed learning community based around programming, in New York City. This time, they accepted me!</p>
<p>I started in late September 2020. My initial plan had too many items to be realistic: interplanetary networking! esolangs! historical fundamentals in computer science! Csound! shaders!</p>
<p>So far I decided to keep the esolangs and historical fundamentals in computer science, and to work on a <a href="https://github.com/eviau/apeiron">minimalistic text editor</a> that was started in July 2020. I also want to spend lots of time pair programming! The rest will have to wait :)</p>

<p>Like you might have read elsewhere, the RC community is kind, thoughtful and helpful. It has made self-directed learning particularly fun! No matter your computer-related interests, there will be someone to chat with.</p>
<p>I feel that doing self-directed work under the RC umbrella helps to justify taking time off to improve yourself at something you like - it gives credibility to the process.</p>

<p>Having had the time to experiment on self-directed learning and work in the current year and in the past, I still struggle with finding the right schedule to keep.</p>
