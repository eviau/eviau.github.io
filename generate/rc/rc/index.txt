<p>The <a href="https://www.recurse.com">Recurse Center</a>is a self-directed retreat for programmers in New York City. I was a participant this year, spending lots of time in <a href="https://www.recurse.com/virtual-rc">Virtual RC</a>, given that everything is online now.</p>
<p>This series of blog posts is about how I spent my time at the Recuse Center (RC). Here are the summaries of my activities:</p>
<p><a href="https://eviau.github.io/rc/zero.html">0- My first three weeks at RC</a></p>
<p><a href="https://eviau.github.io/rc/one.html">1- My next three weeks at RC</a></p>
<p><a href="https://eviau.github.io/rc/two.html">2- My next three weeks at RC</a></p>
<p><a href="https://eviau.github.io/rc/three.html">3- My last three weeks at RC</a></p>
<p>I encourage you to apply to RC if you are interested in becoming a better programmer and in self-structured learning!</p>
