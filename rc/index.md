# Never graduate ! - being at the Recurse Center (RC)

The [Recurse Center](https://www.recurse.com)is a self-directed retreat for programmers in New York City. I was a participant this year, spending lots of time in [Virtual RC](https://www.recurse.com/virtual-rc), given that everything is online now. 

This series of blog posts is about how I spent my time at the Recuse Center (RC). Here are the summaries of my activities:
[0- My first three weeks at RC](https://eviau.github.io/rc/zero.html)
[1- My next three weeks at RC](https://eviau.github.io/rc/one.html)
[2- My next three weeks at RC](https://eviau.github.io/rc/two.html)
[3- My last three weeks at RC](https://eviau.github.io/rc/three.html)

I encourage you to apply to RC if you are interested in becoming a better programmer and in self-structured learning!
