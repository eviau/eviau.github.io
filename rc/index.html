            <h3>First batch - full batch, 2020</h3>

            <p>The <a href="https://www.recurse.com">Recurse Center</a> is a self-directed retreat for programmers in New York City. I was a participant this year (2020), spending lots of time in <a href="https://www.recurse.com/virtual-rc">Virtual RC</a>, given
                that everything is online now.</p>

            <p>This series of blog posts is about how I spent my time at the Recurse Center (RC). Here are the summaries of my activities:</p>

            <p><a href="https://eviau.github.io/rc/zero.html">0- My first three weeks at RC</a></p>

            <p><a href="https://eviau.github.io/rc/one.html">1- My next three weeks at RC</a></p>

            <p><a href="https://eviau.github.io/rc/two.html">2- My next three weeks at RC</a></p>

            <p><a href="https://eviau.github.io/rc/three.html">3- My last three weeks at RC</a></p>

            <p>I encourage you to apply to RC if you are interested in becoming a better programmer and in self-structured learning!</p>
