During the third-quarter of the batch, I spent my time on documenting my own work, trying to finish the [OS tutorial](https://www.cl.cam.ac.uk/projects/raspberrypi/tutorials/os/), welcoming the new batch and taking part in the Generative Art & Music week!

I also spent a good amount of time on job searching activities and on personal matters, which kept me from doing as much as I wanted to regarding my projects.

I finally gave my Gödel’s incompleteness theorem talk at the reading group for Early/Fundamental CS papers - which went well! It was more difficult than expected to really flesh out the proof - I knew it wouldn’t be easy, but I lacked the motivation and time to really dive into the proof and try to make it work for me. This [Quanta Magazine article](https://www.quantamagazine.org/how-godels-incompleteness-theorems-work-20200714/) includes good examples of the mechanics of the proof, although I cannot say how faithful it is to the original proof. I have also read the [book by Nagel and Newman](https://www.nature.com/articles/454829a), also helpful.

I had a rough time trying to shelve projects that were not useful for me, for now - or that I felt like putting aside. I did a small collective shelving projects ‘ceremony’ and invited others to shelve projects together, thanking the projects for what was learned through working on them. I often feel bad for abandoning ideas or projects before they are done, so giving myself the permission to do so was effective in moving on from them - for now at least! I am still planning on going back to my text-editor / todo app later on, called [apeiron](https://github.com/eviau/apeiron).

One of my long-term goal is to be better at documenting my own work. Work often feels like it doesn't really exist if there is no picture, no gif, no READMEs… so let’s write some and take some screenshots! I have done so for [some projects on github](https://github.com/eviau) and I am working on submitting an [artist profile at Artexte](https://artexte.ca/).

A thing I was happy to help organize and host is an [esolang](http://esolangs.org/wiki/Main_Page) workshop, which was an invitation to bring people together on designing and implementing their own esolang. For me, it was the opportunity to translate the [docs for fleuve to English](https://github.com/eviau/fleuve/tree/main/english_version).

Other projects also include: starting an [excel2python](https://github.com/eviau/excel2python) blog series; a [Csound](https://csound.com/) workshop; a zine make & tell; finishing preparing my [mailing list](http://eepurl.com/hbJ1Rb) for [finartcialist](https://www.finartcialist.com); worked on [finartcialist sound art](https://finartcialist.bandcamp.com); showcased my [Lorenz attractor synth](https://github.com/eviau/residencesolo) at the Art week show. I also did a full-stack data science project, hosted on Heroku, about [the Montréal’s public libraries most borrowed novels](http://bibliotheques-mtl.herokuapp.com/).

I will [write my thoughts on the OS programming tutorial](https://eviau.github.io/ecrits/os_programming.html) towards the end of my batch - stay tuned !
