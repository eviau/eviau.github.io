# My first three weeks at RC
*October 9th, 2020*

Last May, I decided to do some self-structured work on my arts projects in the shape of a [self-residence, at home](https://eviau.github.io/residencesolo/). I wanted to see how well I could/would adjust to self-directed learning, in a slightly more structured way than what I was used to.

Having enjoyed the experience, I was soon applying (again) to the [Recurse Center](https://www.recurse.com), a self-directed learning community based around programming, in New York City. This time, they accepted me!

I started in late September 2020. My initial plan had too many items to be realistic: interplanetary networking!  esolangs! historical fundamentals in computer science!  Csound! shaders!

So far I decided to keep the esolangs and historical fundamentals in computer science, and to work on a [minimalistic text editor](https://github.com/eviau/apeiron) that was started in July 2020. I also want to spend lots of time pair programming! The rest will have to wait :)

## Things to love about RC

Like you might have read elsewhere, the RC community is kind, thoughtful and helpful. It has made self-directed learning particularly fun! No matter your computer-related interests, there will be someone to chat with.

I feel that doing self-directed work under the RC umbrella helps to justify taking time off to improve yourself at something you like - it gives credibility to the process.

## Things to work on in the future

Having had the time to experiment on self-directed learning and work in the current year and in the past, I still struggle with finding the right schedule to keep.
